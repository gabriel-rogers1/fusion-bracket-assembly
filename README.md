# Fusion Bracket Assembly

**Role:** Mechanical Designer  
**Tools:** Autodesk Fusion  
**Focus:** Parametric modeling, assemblies, fabrication documentation

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a parametric mechanical bracket assembly designed
with constraint-driven geometry and real-world fabrication considerations.

Geometry is driven by sketch dimensions, allowing predictable design
modifications while maintaining assembly integrity.

The assembly includes hardware placement and fabrication-ready documentation.

---

## Design Scope

- Sketch-driven parametric parts
- Hardware modeled and constrained
- Assembly fit validation
- Fabrication-ready drawings

---

## Deliverables

- STEP assembly export
- Individual part STLs
- [Fabrication Drawing (PDF)](docs/bracket-assembly-drawing.pdf)
- Rendered assembly views

---

## Notes

This project focuses on maintainable parametric structure and clarity of design
intent rather than visual styling.
