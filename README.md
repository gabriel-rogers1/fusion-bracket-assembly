# Fusion Bracket Assembly

**Role:** Mechanical Designer  
**Tools:** Autodesk Fusion  
**Focus:** Parametric modeling, assemblies, fabrication documentation

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a parametric mechanical bracket assembly designed
with constraint-driven geometry and real-world fabrication considerations.

Geometry is driven by sketch dimensions, allowing predictable design
modifications while maintaining assembly integrity.

The assembly model uses constrained component relationships and dimension-driven geometry to support predictable design modifications and clean documentation outputs.

## Design Scope

- Sketch-driven parametric parts
- Hardware modeled and constrained
- Assembly fit validation
- Fabrication-ready drawings

---

## Deliverables

- **Fabrication Drawing (PDF)**: [bracket-assembly-drawing.pdf](bracket-assembly-drawing.pdf)  
- **Assembly STEP Export**: - [Assembly STEP Export](https://github.com/gabriel-rogers1/fusion-bracket-assembly/blob/main/deliverables/step/bracket-assembly.step) 
- **Individual Part STLs**: [STL files (base, mid, custom screws)](deliverables/stl/)

## Notes

This project focuses on maintainable parametric structure and clarity of design
intent.
